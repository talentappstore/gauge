Sample assessment app, as per http://talentappstore.github.io/tas-tenant-apis/doc/assessment-apps.html.

This app demonstrates a single assessment type, a basic math quiz.

When the user starts the assessment, the app fetches assessment details, fetches view details, and then updates the assessment to the "In progress" status, and points the candidate to a wbe page controlled by the app.
